Good news for every Javascript developer who missed a JGiven-like BDD framework! The first version of [JsGiven](https://jsgiven.org/) has been released by [Florent Le Gall](https://github.com/flegall). It applies the concepts of JGiven to the world of Javascript and uses the JGiven HTML5 report for reporting.
