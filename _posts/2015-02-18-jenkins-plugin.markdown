Thanks to [Stefan Wolf](https://twitter.com/wolfs42), there exists now a [Jenkins plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/JGiven+Plugin) for JGiven!
The plugin allows you to generate JGiven reports as a post-build action of a Jenkins job. The resulting reports are then directly accessible via the Jenkins UI.
