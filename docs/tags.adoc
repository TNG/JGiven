== Tags
:sourcedir: ../jgiven-examples/src/test/java/com/tngtech/jgiven/examples

Tags are used to organize scenarios. A tag in JGiven is just a Java annotation that is itself annotated with the http://jgiven.org/javadoc/com/tngtech/jgiven/annotation/IsTag.html[`@IsTag`] annotation. You can annotate whole test classes or single test methods with tag annotations. Tags then appear in the resulting report.

Let’s say you want to know which scenarios covers the coffee feature. To do so you define a new Java annotation:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/tags/ExampleCategory.java[tags=noPackage,indent=0]
----

Two things are important: 

1. The annotation itself must be annotated with the `@IsTag` annotation to mark it as a JGiven tag.
2. The annotation must have retention policy RUNTIME so that JGiven can recognize it at runtime.

To tag a scenario with the new tag, you just annotate the corresponding test method:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/tags/TagHierarchyExampleTest.java[tags=taginaction,indent=0]
----

In the report the scenario will then be tagged with tag CoffeeFeature.

You can also annotate the whole test class, in which case all scenarios of that class will get the tag.

=== Descriptions

Tags can have descriptions. These descriptions appear in the report on the corresponding page for the tag. For example:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/tags/TagsWithCustomStyle.java[tags=desc,indent=0]
----

=== Overriding the Name

It is possible to override the name of a tag by using the `name` attribute of the `IsTag` annotation. This allows you to have a different name for the tag than the actual type of the annotation. For example, if you want to have a tag `Feature: Coffee` you can define the `CoffeeFeature` annotation as follows:

[source,java]
----
@IsTag( name = "Feature: Coffee" )
@Retention( RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME )
public @interface CoffeeFeature { }
----

=== Values

Sometimes you do not want to always create a new annotation for each tag. Let’s say you organize your work in stories and for each story you want to know which scenarios have been written for that story. Instead of having a separate annotation for each story you can define a `Story` annotation with a `value()` method:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/tags/CategoryWithValue.java[tags=noPackage,indent=0]
----

Annotations with different values are treated as different tags in JGiven. So using the above annotation you can now mark scenarios to belong to certain stories:


[source,java]
----
@Test @Story("ACME-123")
public void scenarios_can_have_tags() {
  ...
}
----
In the report the tag will now be `ACME-123` instead of `Story`.

If you want that the type is prepended to the value in the report you can set the `prependType` attribute of the `IsTag` annotation to `true`. In this case the tag will be shown as `Story-ACME-123`. Note that this feature works in combination with the `name` attribute.

Annotations with the same type but different values are grouped in the report. E.g. multiple `@Story` tags with different values will be grouped under `Story`.

==== Array Values

The value of a tag annotation can also be an array:

[source,java]
----
@IsTag
@Retention( RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME )
public @interface Story {
    String[] value();
}
----
This allows you to give the same scenario multiple tags of the same type with different values:


[source,java]
----
@Test @Story( {"ACME-123", "ACME-456"} )
public void scenarios_can_have_tags() {
  ...
}
----

For each value, one tag will be generated, e.g. `ACME-123` and `ACME-456`. If you do not want that behavior you can set the `explodeArray` attribute of `@IsTag` to `false`, in that case only one tag will be generated and the values will comma-separated, e.g. `ACME-123,ACME-456`.

==== Value Dependent Description

When the description of a tag depends on its value you cannot simply set the description on the `@IsTag` annotation, because it will be the same for all values.

Let’s assume you have an `@Issue` tag and want to have a link to the corresponding GitHub issue in the description. To do so you can provide your own http://jgiven.org/javadoc/com/tngtech/jgiven/annotation/TagDescriptionGenerator.html[`TagDescriptionGenerator`] implementation that generates a description of a tag depending on its actual value:


[source,java]
----
public class IssueDescriptionGenerator implements TagDescriptionGenerator {
    @Override
    public String generateDescription( TagConfiguration tagConfiguration,
            Annotation annotation, Object value ) {
        return String.format(
           "<a href='https://github.com/TNG/JGiven/issues/%s'>Issue %s</a>",
            value, value );
    }
}
----
The new `IssueDescriptionGenerator` must now be configured for the `@Issue` annotation using the http://jgiven.org/javadoc/com/tngtech/jgiven/annotation/IsTag.html#descriptionGenerator%28%29[`descriptionGenerator`] attribute of `@IsTag`:


[source,java]
----
@IsTag( descriptionGenerator = IssueDescriptionGenerator.class )
@Retention( RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME )
public @interface Issue {
    String[] value();
}
----

=== Overriding the Value

If you want to group several annotations with different types under a common name. You can combine the `name` attribute with the `value` attribute as follows:


[source,java]
----
@IsTag( name = "Feature", value = "Tag" )
@Retention( RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME )
public @interface FeatureTags { }
----
The tag will appear as `Tag` in the report and all annotations with name Feature will be grouped together.

=== Hierarchical Tags

If your number of tags grow you typically want to organize your tags somehow. This is easily possible in JGiven by forming tag hierarchies. A tag hierarchy is defined by just annotating a tag annotation with other tags. Each of these tags will then become a parent tag in the hierarchy. For example, if you want to organize your features into ‘Core Features’ and ‘Secondary Features’ you can do so by first defining two tags `@CoreFeature` and `@SecondaryFeature` for each of these categories as you would define a normal JGiven tag. If you now want to define a feature tag as a Core Feature you just annotated that tag accordingly:



[source,java]
----
@CoreFeature
@IsTag
@Retention( RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME )
public @interface OneOfMyCoolCoreFeatures {}
----
