== Attachments

Steps can have attachments. This is useful, for example, to save sceenshots during tests or to refer to larger files that should not be printed inline in the report.

=== Creating Attachments

There are several ways to create an attachment by using static factory methods of the http://jgiven.org/javadoc/com/tngtech/jgiven/attachment/Attachment.html[`Attachment`] class. For example, you can create textual attachments from a given `String` by using the `fromText` method.

[source,java]
----
Attachment attachment = Attachment.fromText("Hello World", MediaType.PLAIN_TEXT);
----

==== Titles

Attachments can have an optional title which can be used by reports, for example, to show a tooltip. The title is set with the `withTitle` method:

[source,java]
----
Attachment attachment = Attachment
    .fromText("Hello World", MediaType.PLAIN_TEXT)
    .withTitle("Some Title");
----

==== Binary Attachments

Binary attachments are internally stored by JGiven as Base64-encoded strings. If the binary content is already present as a Base64-encoded string one can just use that to create a binary attachment:


[source,java]
----
Attachment attachment = Attachment
    .fromBase64("SGVsbG8gV29ybGQK", MediaType.application("jgiven"));
----

=== Adding Attachments to Steps

To add an attachment to a step you have to first inject the http://jgiven.org/javadoc/com/tngtech/jgiven/CurrentStep.html[`CurrentStep`] class into your stage class by using `@ExpectedScenarioState`.


[source,java]
----
@ExpectedScenarioState
CurrentStep currentStep;
----

Now you can use `currentStep` inside step methods to add attachments using the http://jgiven.org/javadoc/com/tngtech/jgiven/CurrentStep.html#addAttachment%28com.tngtech.jgiven.attachment.Attachment%29[`addAttachment`] method. The method takes as argument an instance of http://jgiven.org/javadoc/com/tngtech/jgiven/attachment/Attachment.html[`Attachment`].


[source,java]
----
public SELF my_step_with_attachment() {
    Attachment attachment = ...
    currentStep.addAttachment( attachment );
    return self();
}
----
=== Example: Taking Screenshots with Selenium WebDriver

If you are using Selenium WebDriver and want to add screenshots to a JGiven step you can do so as follows:


[source,java]
----
String base64 = ( (TakesScreenshot) webDriver ).getScreenshotAs( OutputType.BASE64 );
currentStep.addAttachment( Attachment.fromBase64( base64, MediaType.PNG )
           .withTitle( "Screenshot" ) );
----
For a full example, see the https://github.com/TNG/JGiven/blob/master/jgiven-tests/src/test/java/com/tngtech/jgiven/report/html5/Html5AppStage.java[Html5AppStage] class that is used by the JGiven tests.
